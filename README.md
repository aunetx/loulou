# Loulou

## Getting started
### Description :
This python projects aims to bring a new deep learning implementation to frond-end developers.\
It currently supports MNIST database and then can train neural networks on it, and predict grayscale 28*28px image that represents a number from 0 to 9.
### Prerequisites :
You must install `numpy` to use Loulou.\
In intend to show image that is predicted, you must also install `matplotlib`.

From `pip` :
```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib #(optional)
```
### Installation :
To install and use it, just do :
```
git clone https://github.com/aunetx/loulou
cd loulou/scripts
python run.py [path/to/train.npy] [path/to/image.png]
```
For the training, support is added in a few days (rewriting it).

### Versions :
* Version 1.0.0 : Initial version, works with another implementation - need some changes
